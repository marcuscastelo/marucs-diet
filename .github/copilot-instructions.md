# Copilot Instructions Modularized

All code generation instructions have been split into focused instruction files in `.github/instructions/`.

- [General instructions](./instructions/general.instructions.md)
- [Refactoring & Automation](./instructions/refactoring.instructions.md)
- [JSDoc](./instructions/jsdoc.instructions.md)
- [Language, Naming & Structure](./instructions/naming-language.instructions.md)
- [Domain Clean Architecture](./instructions/domain-clean-architecture.instructions.md)
- [Application Clean Architecture](./instructions/application-clean-architecture.instructions.md)
- [Promises, Formatting, Imports, Testing](./instructions/promises-formatting-testing.instructions.md)

These are automatically applied according to their `applyTo` context.
