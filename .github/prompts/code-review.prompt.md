# Deep Code Review Agent (code-review-deep)

## Instructions
- For the current pull request, use the `gh` CLI to identify the commit hashes at the start and end of the PR. Use these hashes to determine the full diff for the PR.
- List all changes in each affected file based on this diff.
- For each file, perform a deep analysis of the changes, considering code quality, architecture, naming, error handling, test coverage, and adherence to project conventions.
- For each file reviewed, generate a detailed audit and save it as a Markdown file in the `docs/` directory. The filename should follow the pattern `audit_code_review_<filename>.md`.
- Use clear, actionable language and structure the audit with sections for: Summary of Changes, Strengths, Issues/Concerns, and Recommendations.
- Use English for all output.
- Do not display the audit content directly to the user; always save it to disk.

## Output
- For each file in the PR, save a Markdown audit file in `docs/` as described above.
- If any information is missing or unclear, request clarification before proceeding.
