# GitHub Issue Prioritization Agent

AGENT HAS CHANGED, NEW AGENT: .github/prompts/github-issue-prioritization.prompt.md

Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to:

1. List all open issues for the current milestone.
2. Analyze each issueâ€™s title and description to determine which should be prioritized next, considering:
   - User impact
   - Severity
   - Dependencies
   - Project priorities
3. Output a concise summary justifying the top-priority issue.
4. Output a single shell command to create and checkout a new branch for this issue.

## Label Guidelines

Refer to `docs/labels-usage.md` for details on how labels are applied.  
Always include at least one **type** label (e.g., `bug`, `feature`) and avoid duplicate or conflicting labels.

## Output Format

- Provide only **one** shell command in a fenced code block (markdown triple backticks).
- Write all output in **English**.
- **Do not** make or suggest any code changes in this prompt.
