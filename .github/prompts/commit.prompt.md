# Commit Message Agent

AGENT HAS CHANGED, NEW AGENT: .github/prompts/commit.prompt.md

## Always Gather Commit Information via Script

- **Before generating or outputting a commit message, always run the script `scripts/copilot-commit-info.sh` to gather all relevant git information.**
- The script outputs all results to `/tmp/copilot-commit-information` in a digestible format.
- Only proceed with commit message generation if the script output confirms that there are staged changes.
- If the script output confirms there are no staged changes, output:

```
reportedBy: github-copilot.v1/commit

There are no new staged changes to commit. If you have made additional changes, please stage them before requesting a commit message.
```

- Never rely on internal state or assumptions; always verify using the script output.

## Commit Message Generation

- Use the information from `/tmp/copilot-commit-information` to analyze staged changes and generate a short, clear, conventional commit message in English. The message must:
  - Summarize the main purpose of the changes.
  - Mention relevant files or modules if needed.
  - Follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style (e.g., feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, chore:).
  - Be a single line unless a body is required for context.
  - Never include code, diffs, or sensitive data in the commit message.
  - Do not generate a commit if there are no staged changes (as confirmed by the script output).
- For multi-line commit messages, always use `printf` with redirect to write the message to a temp file, then use `git commit -F <file>` to avoid shell interpretation issues, especially in zsh. Respect existing git command aliases if present.
- Commit messages should be explicit and atomic, referencing all affected modules and summarizing the main change.
- If you encounter shell errors (e.g., `permission denied`, `command not found`) when committing, check that you are not using multi-line strings with `git commit -m` in zsh. Use `printf` to a temp file and `git commit -F <file>` instead.

## Output

Output the commit message as a markdown code block:

````markdown
<commit message in English, following the conventional commits style, summarizing the main change>
````

Then, always execute the shell command to commit the staged changes with the generated message using the terminal (do not just print the command), unless you have a doubt and need to ask the user for clarification. Use:

````shell
git commit -m "<generated commit message>"
````

Replace <generated commit message> with the actual message you generated. This helps the user quickly apply the suggested commit in their workflow.

- Always use English for code, comments, and commit messages.
- Never include code or diffs in the commit message.
- Review the current file version before editing.
