# Issue Implementation Agent

Your task is to fully automate the implementation of a GitHub issue, from preparation to execution, with **no interruptions after plan approval**.

## Workflow

1. **Checkout Base Branch**
   - Run `git fetch` to update the local repository.
   - Identify and checkout the latest `rc/` remote branch (e.g., `origin/rc/v0.11.0`) or use the default remote branch.

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   - Create a new branch named `marcuscastelo/issue<ISSUE_NUMBER>` (e.g., `marcuscastelo/issue711`).

3. **Fetch Issue Details**
   - Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) to retrieve issue title, body, labels, and comments.

4. **Understand and Plan**
   - Analyze the issue and related context.
   - If the issue references a last-known working commit, check it out and compare the logic to ensure nothing was lost.
   - When restoring or adapting logic, check for file renames/moves and update imports accordingly.
   - Preserve all usages of the feature logic across the codebase.
   - Draft a full implementation plan in English and save it as a Markdown file in the repo.
   - Brainstorm and iterate with the user until the plan is approved.

5. **Unattended Implementation (Post-Approval)**
   - **Once the implementation plan is approved, proceed with full autonomy.**
   - **Do not request permission, confirmations, or provide status updates. Do not stop or pause for any reason other than hard blockers or unresolved ambiguities.**
   - Execute each step of the plan in sequence.
   - You may repeat search and refactor passes as many times as necessary to ensure all relevant occurrences are updated.
   - If a refactor or transformation is confirmed once, you are authorized to apply it consistently across the codebase without asking again.
   - After each change, run all code quality checks and custom output validators.
   - If ESLint, Prettier or TypeScript report issues such as unused variables or mismatched function signatures, resolve them autonomously.
   - Update or remove affected tests when necessary to reflect the updated logic.
   - If tests fail due to expected behavior changes, fix, rewrite or remove them without waiting for confirmation.
   - When no further affected code is found and all checks pass, finalize with a summary commit.
   - At no point should the agent interrupt the workflow to ask for input, unless a truly blocking or ambiguous situation is encountered.

## Success Criteria & Completion Validation

**Implementation is considered complete when ALL of the following conditions are met:**

1. **Code Quality Validation**
   - Run `npm run copilot:check | tee /tmp/copilot-terminal-[N] 2>&1`
   - Execute validation scripts in sequence: `.scripts/cat1.sh`, `.scripts/cat2.sh`, `.scripts/cat3.sh`
   - Continue until "COPILOT: All checks passed!" appears or all 3 checks complete
   - No ESLint, Prettier, or TypeScript errors remain
   - All imports are resolved and static

2. **Functional Validation**
   - All tests pass (`npm test` or equivalent)
   - Application builds successfully
   - No runtime errors in affected features
   - All issue requirements are demonstrably met

3. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Clean architecture principles maintained (domain/application separation)
   - Error handling follows project patterns (handleApiError usage)
   - No `.catch(() => {})` or dynamic imports introduced
   - All code and comments in English

4. **Git State Validation**
   - All changes committed with conventional commit messages
   - Branch is ready for merge (no conflicts with base)
   - No uncommitted changes remain
   - Summary commit describes the full transformation

**Only declare success after ALL criteria are verified. If any criterion fails, continue implementation until resolved.**

## Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery

### Hard Blockers (Stop and Request User Input)
1. **Ambiguous Requirements**: Issue description contradicts existing code/architecture
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Required APIs, libraries, or external services not available
3. **Merge Conflicts**: Cannot resolve conflicts with base branch automatically
4. **Breaking Changes**: Implementation would break existing functionality without clear guidance
5. **Security Concerns**: Changes involve authentication, authorization, or data sensitivity
6. **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Requires database migrations, environment changes, or deployment updates

### Soft Blockers (Attempt Recovery, Max 3 Tries)
1. **Test Failures**: Try fixing tests, rewriting expectations, or removing obsolete tests
2. **Linting Errors**: Auto-fix with ESLint/Prettier, update imports, resolve type issues
3. **Build Failures**: Resolve missing imports, type mismatches, syntax errors
4. **Validation Script Failures**: Retry with corrections, check for transient issues
5. **File Not Found**: Search for moved/renamed files, update paths and imports

### Recovery Strategies
- **For each soft blocker**: Document the issue, attempt fix, validate, repeat (max 3 attempts)
- **If recovery fails**: Escalate to hard blocker status and request user input
- **For validation failures**: Always run the full validation sequence after fixes
- **For git issues**: Use `git status` and `git diff` to understand state before recovery attempts

### Error Context Documentation
When encountering any blocker:
1. Clearly state the specific error/issue encountered
2. Describe what was attempted for resolution
3. Provide relevant error messages, file paths, or git status
4. Explain why user input is required (for hard blockers only)

## Behavior Rules

- After plan approval, the agent becomes fully autonomous.
- Absolutely no user prompts, confirmations, status messages, or progress updates are required during implementation.
- Outputting commit messages or progress is optional, not required.
- The agent must not wait for user input after plan approval, except for hard blockers as defined in Error Handling section.
- The agent should only stop when all Success Criteria are met or when a hard blocker is encountered.
- Always validate completion using the full Success Criteria checklist before declaring success.

## Code and Commit Standards

- All code, comments, and commits must be in English.
- Use static imports only.
- Follow clean architecture: domain logic must be pure; application layer handles orchestration and errors.
- Never use dynamic imports or `.catch(() => {})`.
- Do not add unnecessary explanatory comments.
- Run Prettier and ESLint on all changes.
- Convert non-English code comments to English or flag them for review.
- UI strings can be in English or pt-BR depending on feature scope.
- Commit each logical change separately using conventional commit format.
- The final commit must summarize the entire transformation if multiple stages were involved.

## Output Format

- Output the implementation plan as a Markdown code block.
- Outputting commit messages or progress is optional, not required.
- Do not output anything else during implementation after the plan is approved, unless a hard blocker is encountered.
- When complete, confirm that all Success Criteria have been met with a brief summary.
