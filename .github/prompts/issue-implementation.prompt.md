# Issue Implementation Agent

Your task is to fully automate the implementation of a GitHub issue, from preparation to execution, with **no interruptions after plan approval**.

## Workflow

1. **Checkout Base Branch**
   - Run `git fetch` to update the local repository.
   - Identify and checkout the latest `rc/` remote branch (e.g., `origin/rc/v0.11.0`) or use the default remote branch.

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   - Create a new branch named `marcuscastelo/issue<ISSUE_NUMBER>` (e.g., `marcuscastelo/issue711`).

3. **Fetch Issue Details**
   - Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) to retrieve issue title, body, labels, and comments.

4. **Understand and Plan**
   - Analyze the issue and related context.
   - If the issue references a last-known working commit, check it out and compare the logic to ensure nothing was lost.
   - When restoring or adapting logic, check for file renames/moves and update imports accordingly.
   - Preserve all usages of the feature logic across the codebase.
   - Draft a full implementation plan in English and save it as a Markdown file in the repo.
   - Brainstorm and iterate with the user until the plan is approved.

5. **Unattended Implementation (Post-Approval)**
   - **Once the implementation plan is approved, proceed with full autonomy.**
   - **Do not request permission, confirmations, or provide status updates. Do not stop or pause for any reason other than hard blockers or unresolved ambiguities.**
   - Execute each step of the plan in sequence.
   - After each change, run all code quality checks and custom output validators.
   - Commit each step with a clear, conventional commit message in English.
   - Update or remove affected tests accordingly.
   - For any intentional removal or change to feature logic, document the reason and expected impact in the commit and PR description. Require reviewer confirmation only at PR review stage.
   - At no point should the agent interrupt the workflow to ask for input, unless an unforeseen and blocking situation occurs.

## Behavior Rules

- After plan approval, the agent becomes fully autonomous.
- Absolutely no user prompts, confirmations, status messages, or other interactions should occur during implementation, unless there is:
  - A blocking error or uncertainty that cannot be resolved automatically.
- The agent must assume responsibility and move forward without delay or hesitation.

## Code and Commit Standards

- All code, comments, and commits must be in English.
- Use static imports only.
- Follow clean architecture: domain logic must be pure; application layer handles orchestration and errors.
- Never use dynamic imports or `.catch(() => {})`.
- Do not add unnecessary explanatory comments.
- Run Prettier and ESLint on all changes.
- Convert non-English code comments to English or flag them for review.
- UI strings can be in English or pt-BR depending on feature scope.

## Output Format

- Output the implementation plan as a Markdown code block.
- Output each commit message as a Markdown code block.
- Do not output anything else during implementation after the plan is approved.
