# Issue Implementation Agent

Your task is to automate the process of implementing a GitHub issue, following these steps:

## Workflow

1. **Checkout Base Branch**
   - Perform a `git fetch` to update the local repository.
   - Identify the highest remote `rc/` branch (e.g., `origin/rc/v0.11.0`) or, if easier, use the default remote branch.
   - Checkout this remote branch.

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   - Create a new branch named `marcuscastelo/issue<ISSUE_NUMBER>` (e.g., `marcuscastelo/issue711`).

3. **Fetch Issue Details**
   - Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to retrieve the issue's title, body, labels, and comments.

4. **Understand and Plan**
   - Analyze the issue and all related information.
   - If the issue references a last known working commit for the feature/logic, check out that commit and compare the relevant files to the current implementation to ensure no critical logic is lost.
   - When restoring or refactoring legacy logic, check for file moves/renames and update imports to match the current codebase structure.
   - Explicitly check for and preserve all usages of the feature logic across the codebase during refactor or migration.
   - Draft a comprehensive implementation plan in English, saving it as a Markdown file in the repository.
   - If the user requests, document feature ideas or open questions as Markdown files for future issues, rather than creating issues immediately. See [copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) for global rules.
   - Present the plan to the user and iterate via brainstorming until the plan is fully approved.

5. **Implement with User Review**
   - **After the plan is approved and the baseline check passes, immediately begin executing the implementation plan, step by step, without pausing for further user review or confirmation.**
   - Only pause and request user input if an unexpected occurrence arises (e.g., a blocker, ambiguity, or error that cannot be resolved automatically).
   - After any code change, always run the full code quality check and custom output validation scripts.
   - The agent leads the implementation; the user acts as a reviewer only in GitHub after the session.
   - After each step, run tests and commit changes with clear, conventional commit messages.
   - Always check for and update JSDoc for all exported functions/types after restoring or refactoring shared logic.
   - If any feature logic is intentionally removed or changed, document the rationale and expected impact in the commit message and PR description, and require explicit user/reviewer confirmation for such changes.

## Requirements

- All code, comments, and commit messages must be in English.
- Use static imports at the top of files.
- Follow clean architecture: domain logic is pure, application layer handles orchestration and error handling.
- Update or remove related tests as needed.
- Use Prettier/ESLint for formatting.
- Never use dynamic imports or `.catch(() => {})` for promises.
- UI text may be in English or pt-BR as required.
- Never add explanatory comments in code unless absolutely necessary.
- Always output the implementation plan and commit messages as Markdown code blocks.
- Explicitly flag and suggest converting any non-English code comments to English during implementation or review. See [copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) for global rules.

## References

- [Copilot Customization Instructions](../instructions/copilot/copilot-customization.instructions.md)
- [Prompt Creation Guide](../prompts/new-prompt.prompt.md)

## Output

- Output the implementation plan as a Markdown code block.
- After each commit, output the commit message as a Markdown code block.
- Do not prompt for review or confirmation after plan approval. Only pause for unexpected occurrences.
