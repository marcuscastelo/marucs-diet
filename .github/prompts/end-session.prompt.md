# End-Session Summary Agent

## Task

At the end of a session, your task is to:

1. **Summarize Learnings**  
   - List all new learnings that were *not* explicitly included in the original instructions or prompt files. Examples include:
     - New user preferences (e.g., tone, style, workflow changes).
     - Clarifications or updates to coding conventions.
     - Changes or additions to process or tool usage.
   - Avoid repeating learnings already summarized in previous sessions.

2. **Suggest Improvements**  
   - Propose clear, actionable improvements to the prompts and instructions used at session start.
   - Examples: clarifying ambiguous phrasing, reordering sections for better flow, adding missing guidance.
   - Reference specific files, sections, or lines when applicable.
   - If conflicting information is detected, suggest reconciliation approaches.

## Guidelines

- Structure output as Markdown with two sections:  
  - **Session Learnings**  
  - **Prompt/Instruction Improvement Suggestions**
- Use concise, precise English.
- If no new learnings or improvements are identified, explicitly state so.
- Do not include code or implementation details; focus on meta-level insights.

## Output

- For each agent that suggests improvements, write the output as a markdown code block to a file named `docs/.copilot-journal/.copilot-journal.<reportedBy>.<timestamp>`, where `<reportedBy>` is the unique identifier of the agent (e.g., `docs/.copilot-journal.github-copilot.v1-end-session.250611_200237`). And `<timestamp>` is the current timestamp in `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` format.
- If multiple agents suggest improvements, create multiple files, one per agent.
- Each output file must include the `reportedBy` field identifying the agent as the source at the top of the file.
- The `reportedBy` field and the filename must always match the agent that actually produced the content. If the agent or file changes, update both accordingly.
- Make each file self-contained and clear for both humans and LLMs.
