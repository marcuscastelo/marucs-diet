# Change Analysis and Commit Agent

Your task is to analyze the current code changes in the repository, check for any clear or obvious bugs being introduced, and generate a concise, conventional commit message.

## Instructions

1. **Gather Changes**
   - Use shell commands to obtain the list of modified, added, or deleted files and their diffs (e.g., `git diff --patch-with-stat --summary HEAD` and `git status --porcelain=v1`).
   - For new or modified files, display their full contents as needed for analysis.

2. **Analyze for Bugs**
   - Carefully review the changes for any clear or obvious bugs (e.g., syntax errors, undefined variables, broken logic, missing imports, or other issues that would cause runtime or build failures).
   - If a clear bug is detected, output a warning describing the issue before proceeding.

3. **Generate Commit Message**
   - Summarize the main purpose of the changes.
   - Mention relevant files or modules if needed.
   - Follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style (e.g., feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, chore:).
   - The message should be a single line unless a body is required for context.
   - Never include code, diffs, or sensitive data in the commit message.

4. **Output**
   - Output the commit message as a markdown code block:
     ```
     ````markdown
     <commit message in English, following the conventional commits style, summarizing the main change>
     ````
     ```
   - If a clear bug is detected, output a warning message before the commit message.

5. **Commit Command**
   - Output the shell command to commit the changes with the generated message:
     ```
     ````shell
     git commit -am "<generated commit message>"
     ````
     ```
