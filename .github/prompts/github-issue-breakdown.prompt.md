# Issue Breakdown Agent

Analyze a GitHub Issue number provided by the user to determine if it should be split into subissues. If so, suggest subissues using the template in `docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE_SUBISSUE.md`.

## Instructions

- Use the `gh` CLI to fetch the issue details and comments.
- Assess if the issue is large, complex, or multi-step and could benefit from subissues.
- If breakdown is needed, summarize why and list suggested subissues, referencing the main modules or steps.
- For each subissue, output the `gh issue create` command, using `printf` with `\n` for newlines, and fill in the template fields. Reference the parent issue and use the `subissue` label. Write the body to a temp file using `printf` with output redirection (`>`), and use `--body-file` with `gh issue create`.
- Do not perform code changes or create subissues in this prompt; only analyze and suggest.
- Use English for all output.

## Label Usage

Refer to `docs/labels-usage.md` for label details. Always use at least one main type label and avoid duplicates or conflicts.

## Output
- Output only the analysis, the list of possible subissues/steps, and the `gh issue create` commands, with each subissue body formatted according to the template in `docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE_SUBISSUE.md`.
- Use English for all output.
