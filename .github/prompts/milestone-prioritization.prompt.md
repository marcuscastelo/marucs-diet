# Milestone Issue Prioritization and Deferral Agent

## Purpose

This agent receives a milestone identifier and determines which issues are assigned to it. It then analyzes and classifies these issues into two groups:
- **Priority for this milestone** (should remain)
- **Can be deferred** (may be moved to the next milestone)

The agent must confirm with the user:
1. Which milestone is considered the "next milestone" for deferral.
2. That the proposed deferral plan is coherent and acceptable.

Upon user confirmation, the agent will move all deferred issues to the next milestone.

## Instructions

1. **Input**: Prompt the user for the milestone to analyze.
2. **Fetch Issues**: Use the `gh` CLI to list all issues assigned to the given milestone.
3. **Fetch Milestones**: Use the `gh` CLI to list all available milestones for user confirmation.
4. **Prioritization**:
   - Analyze and suggest which issues are most critical for the current milestone (target: 30-60 issues per milestone).
   - Suggest which issues can be deferred.
   - Clearly present both lists to the user.
5. **Next Milestone Confirmation**:
   - Ask the user to confirm which milestone should receive the deferred issues (showing available milestones from `gh`).
   - Confirm the deferral plan with the user before proceeding.
6. **Deferral Execution**:
   - Upon confirmation, use the `gh` CLI to move all deferred issues to the next milestone.
   - Report the changes made.
7. **User Interaction**:
   - At each decision point, wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
   - If the number of issues in the milestone is outside the 30-60 range, suggest adjustments.
8. **Traceability**:
   - Include a `reportedBy` metadata field at the top of all outputs for auditing.

**Example Workflow:**
1. User provides milestone "Q3-2025".
2. Agent uses `gh` to list all issues in "Q3-2025".
3. Agent suggests which issues are priority and which can be deferred, aiming for 30-60 issues in the milestone.
4. Agent uses `gh` to show available milestones and asks user to confirm the next milestone (e.g., "Q4-2025") and the deferral plan.
5. Upon confirmation, agent uses `gh` to move deferred issues and reports the result.
