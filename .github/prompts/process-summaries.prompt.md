# Process Summaries and Improve Prompts

For all summaries under `docs/.copilot-journal` (use `ls` + `cat` to view contents), follow these steps:

1. Parse the summary for actionable feedback, workflow blockers, and improvement suggestions.
2. For each prompt or instruction file in the `.github` directory (including subfolders), directly edit the file to address the feedback and suggestions, following the best practices and policies in `./refine-prompt.prompt.md`.
3. **If a rule, instruction, or improvement applies to all prompts/instructions, update only `copilot-instructions.md` with this global instruction, instead of replicating it in each individual file.**
4. Ensure all prompt metadata fields use only allowed values (`mode`: `ask`, `edit`, or `agent`).
5. Make all outputs self-contained, actionable, and in English (except for UI text, which may be in pt-BR if required).
6. If you encounter unclear or incomplete feedback, ask clarifying questions before making changes.
7. After improvements, remove any legacy or boilerplate content that does not serve the current workflow.
8. **After integrating a summary, delete the processed summary file to prevent redundant processing.**
9. Directly edit the improved prompt or instruction file(s) as valid Markdown `.prompt.md` or `.instructions.md` files, with an optional front matter section for metadata.
10. Clarify that the agent must not wait for any further user input after the end-session declarationâ€”actions must be immediate.
11. **Never process or update `.github/prompts/process-summaries.prompt.md` or `.github/prompts/refine-prompt.prompt.md` with this prompt.**

## Output

- Directly edit the improved prompt or instruction file(s) as Markdown files.
- Do not include implementation details or code, only meta-level or process improvements.
- Never process or update `.github/prompts/refine-prompt.prompt.md` or `.github/prompts/process-summaries.prompt.md` with this prompt.

For best practices, always reference and comply with `./refine-prompt.prompt.md`.
