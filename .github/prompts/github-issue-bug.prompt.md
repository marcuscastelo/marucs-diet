# GitHub Issue: Bug Report

AGENT HAS CHANGED, NEW AGENT: .github/prompts/github-issue-bug.prompt.md

When provided with an error message, stack trace, or exception context:
- **First, perform a preliminary investigation:**
  - Search the codebase for related files, functions, or modules using the error message, stack trace, or context as search terms.
  - Summarize or list the most relevant files and their paths.
  - Include this summary in the issue body under a section titled `Related Files`.
- Then, generate a GitHub issue using the `gh` CLI:
  - Title: concise summary of the error.
  - Body: use the template in `docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE_BUGFIX.md`, filling in relevant fields. Do not include the template header.
  - Use only existing labels. If a label or milestone does not exist, prompt the user or skip it.
  - Use `printf` with `\n` for newlines. Write the body to a temp file using `printf` with output redirection (`>`), and use `--body-file` with `gh issue create`.
  - Do not use `echo` or heredoc.
  - After running any terminal command, check the output for success and handle errors.
  - Output only the final command.
  - Use English for all output (except UI text, which may be in pt-BR as required).
  - **Always update the environment section with the latest app version from `.scripts/semver.sh` before submitting or editing an issue.**
  - **Check for the existence of `.scripts/semver.sh` before using it. If missing, suggest alternatives or prompt the user.**
  - **Verify the correct script directory (e.g., `.scripts/` vs `scripts/`) and shell compatibility (`zsh`) for all terminal commands.**
  - **If `.scripts/semver.sh` is missing or not executable, add a troubleshooting step or warning.**

## Label Usage

Refer to `docs/labels-usage.md` for label details. Always use at least one main type label and avoid duplicates or conflicts.

- Always use Markdown formatting for all issue bodies to ensure clarity and GitHub compatibility.
- Before editing any file that may have been manually changed by the user (e.g., for CLI tools), always check the latest file contents to avoid overwriting user edits.
- Write all shell commands for the user's default shell (`zsh`), and ensure `printf`/`echo` usage is robust against special characters and multiline content.
- If file creation or `printf` fails (e.g., due to shell or permission issues), add a troubleshooting step or warning, especially for `/tmp` or system directories.
- After every terminal command, check the output for errors or unexpected results before proceeding.
- Reference and follow all global rules and checklists in [copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md).
- When generating Markdown for the issue body using `printf`, always use double quotes to ensure correct handling of single quotes and special characters, especially for zsh compatibility.
- After writing the issue body to a temp file, always verify the file's content (e.g., `cat /tmp/bug-issue-body.md`) before running `gh issue create`.
- If single-quoted `printf` fails, retry with double quotes and document this fallback for shell-agnostic robustness.
- Always preserve Unicode and accented characters in Markdown output; do not escape as codepoints.
- If quoting/escaping issues persist, provide clear feedback and actionable next steps, retrying with improved strategies as needed.
