# GitHub Issue: Feature Request

AGENT HAS CHANGED, NEW AGENT: .github/prompts/github-issue-feature.prompt.md

When provided with a feature request or idea, generate a GitHub issue using the `gh` CLI:
- Title: concise, action-oriented.
- Body: use the template in `docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE_FEATURE.md`, filling in relevant fields. **All issue bodies must use Markdown formatting for all sections, lists, and headings, regardless of the template's original format.**
- Always use the label `feature`.
- If a milestone is specified and exists, use it; otherwise, prompt or skip.
- Use `printf` with `\n` for newlines. Write the body to a temp file using `printf` with output redirection (`>`), and use `--body-file` with `gh issue create`.
- Do not use `echo` or heredoc.
- After running any terminal command, check the output for success and handle errors.
- Output only the final command.
- Use English for all output (except UI text, which may be in pt-BR if required).
- **Consider adding a step to preview or validate Markdown rendering before submitting or updating issues via the `gh` CLI.**
- **After issue creation or update, confirm with the user, especially when formatting or content is user-sensitive.**
- **Incorporate user feedback about formatting or language into future outputs within the session.**

## Label Usage

Refer to `docs/labels-usage.md` for label details. Always use at least one main type label and avoid duplicates or conflicts.

- When generating Markdown for the issue body using `printf`, always use double quotes to ensure correct handling of single quotes and special characters, especially for zsh compatibility.
- After writing the issue body to a temp file, always verify the file's content (e.g., `cat /tmp/feature-issue-body.md`) before running `gh issue create`.
- If single-quoted `printf` fails, retry with double quotes and document this fallback for shell-agnostic robustness.
- Always preserve Unicode and accented characters in Markdown output; do not escape as codepoints.
- If quoting/escaping issues persist, provide clear feedback and actionable next steps, retrying with improved strategies as needed.
- Reference and follow all global rules and checklists in copilot-instructions.md.
