# Gemini Instructions for Macroflows

At the end of every message, show <End of Response>.

## 1. Project Overview & Context

- **Project Name:** Macroflows
- **Description:** A nutrition tracking platform with a focus on strong typing, reactive UI, and modular domain-driven design.
- **Author:** This is a solo project by `marcuscastelo`.
- **Adaptation:** All suggestions must be adapted for a solo developer. This means removing team coordination, stakeholder approval, and peer review processes. Focus on technical validation and systematic self-review. Maintain all technical quality standards.

## 2. Core Technologies

- **Frontend:** SolidJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime), Vercel
- **Validation:** Zod (for runtime validation and type inference)
- **Testing:** Vitest with jsdom
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Build Tool:** Vinxi (Vite-based)

## 3. 🚨 CRITICAL: Development Workflow & Quality Gates

### 3.1. The Golden Rule: `pnpm check`
- **MANDATORY:** Before declaring any task, fix, or feature complete, you **MUST** run `pnpm check`.
- This command runs linting, type-checking, and all tests. It is the single source of truth for codebase health.
- **NEVER** commit code that fails `pnpm check`.

### 3.2. Workflow Steps
1.  **Implement Changes:** Write or modify the code as requested.
2.  **Run Quality Gate:** Execute `pnpm check`.
3.  **Verify:** Ensure all checks pass with zero errors (TypeScript, ESLint, Tests).
4.  **Commit:** Only after all checks pass, proceed to commit the changes.

### 3.3. Essential Commands
- `pnpm check`: **MANDATORY** quality gate.
- `pnpm fix`: Auto-fix ESLint issues.
- `pnpm build`: Create a production build.
- `pnpm test`: Run all tests.
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint.
- `.scripts/semver.sh`: The preferred method for application version reporting.

## 4. Architecture & Design Principles

### 4.1. Clean Architecture (3 Layers)
The codebase follows a strict 3-layer architecture. Adherence to these boundaries is critical.

1.  **Domain Layer** (`modules/*/domain/`)
    - Contains pure business logic, entities, types (Zod schemas), and repository interfaces.
    - **MUST NOT** have any dependencies on external frameworks or libraries (like SolidJS or Supabase).
    - **MUST NOT** contain any side-effects (e.g., API calls, logging, toasts).
    - **MUST ONLY** throw pure, custom domain errors.
    - Use `__type` discriminators for type safety in entities.

2.  **Application Layer** (`modules/*/application/`)
    - Orchestrates the domain logic. Contains SolidJS resources, signals, and application-specific logic.
    - **MUST** catch errors from the Domain layer.
    - **MUST** call `handleApiError` to standardize error handling and provide context.
    - Manages all side-effects and user feedback (toasts, notifications).

3.  **Infrastructure Layer** (`modules/*/infrastructure/`)
    - Implements the repository interfaces defined in the Domain layer.
    - Contains all external integrations, such as Supabase client code and Data Access Objects (DAOs).
    - This is the **ONLY** layer where `any` might be permissible, strictly for interfacing with external, untyped APIs.

### 4.2. Dependency Injection (DI) Pattern
- The project uses an explicit, manual Dependency Injection pattern.
- **Orchestration functions** (business logic) in the Application Layer **MUST NOT** import dependencies (repositories, fetchers) directly.
- Instead, these dependencies **MUST** be passed as arguments to the function.
- This decouples application logic from infrastructure, making it highly testable.
- **Example:** A `fetchTemplatesByTabLogic` function should receive a `deps` object containing all necessary fetchers (`fetchUserRecipes`, `fetchFoods`, etc.) as a parameter.

### 4.3. File & Module Structure
- `src/modules/<domain>/`: Houses the three architecture layers for a specific domain.
  - `tests/`: All tests for a module must be placed in this folder.
- `src/sections/<feature>/`: Contains page-level UI components, organized by feature.
- `src/shared/`: Cross-cutting concerns (error handling, configs, pure utilities).
- `src/routes/`: SolidJS router pages and API endpoints.

## 5. Critical Code Style & Patterns

### 5.1. Imports: The Three Rules
1.  **Absolute Imports ONLY:** Always use absolute paths with the `~/` prefix.
    - ✅ `import { MyType } from '~/modules/user/domain/user';`
    - ❌ `import { MyType } from '../../user/domain/user';`
2.  **Barrel Files (`index.ts`) are BANNED:** All imports must point directly to the file where the entity is defined. Do not create or use `index.ts` files that only re-export from other files.
3.  **Static Imports ONLY:** All imports must be static and at the top of the file. Dynamic `import()` is forbidden.

### 5.2. Language & Naming
- **Language:** All code, comments, JSDoc, and commit messages **MUST** be in **English**. UI text visible to the user may be in Portuguese (pt-BR).
- **Naming:** Use descriptive, specific, action-based names. Avoid generic names.
    - ✅ **Good:** `isRecipedGroupUpToDate()`, `convertToGroups()`, `ItemGroupEditModal.tsx`, `macroOverflow.ts`
    - ❌ **Bad:** `checkGroup()`, `convert()`, `GroupModal.tsx`, `utils.ts`

### 5.3. Type Safety & Formatting
- **NO `any`:** The use of `any`, `as any`, or `@ts-ignore` is strictly forbidden outside the Infrastructure layer.
- **`type` over `interface`:** Always use type aliases for defining data shapes.
- **Readonly:** Prefer `readonly Item[]` over `Item[]` for immutability.
- **Props Immutability:** **NEVER** destructure `props` in SolidJS components, as it breaks reactivity.

### 5.4. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Code Duplication:** Avoid copy-pasting logic. For example, the clipboard and validation logic was duplicated between `MealEditView.tsx` and `RecipeEditView.tsx`. This should be abstracted into a shared utility.

### 5.5. Error Handling
- **Domain:** Throws pure errors (e.g., `throw new GroupConflictError(...)`).
- **Application:** Catches domain errors and **MUST** use `handleApiError(e, { context })`.
- **NEVER** use `.catch(() => {})` to silence promise errors. Use the `void` operator only for non-critical, fire-and-forget side-effects in event handlers where errors are handled at the application level.

### 5.6. Commits & JSDoc
- **Commits:** Use the Conventional Commits specification. Messages must be in English. **NEVER** include "Generated by..." or "Co-authored-by..." footers from AI tools.
- **JSDoc:** Update JSDoc for all **exported** types and functions. Do not add JSDoc to internal code.

## 6. Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy

### 6.1. Core Domain Entities
Testing should be structured around the core business domains. The main entities are:
- `MacroProfile`
- `Weight`
- `DayDiet`
- `UnifiedItem` (and its variants: `FoodItem`, `RecipeItem`, `GroupItem`)
- `Food`
- `Recipe`
- `Meal`

### 6.2. Testing Philosophy
- **Location:** All tests for a module must be placed in its `tests/` folder.
- **User Input Validation vs. System Errors:**
    - **Validation Errors:** Expected errors from invalid user input (e.g., entering text in a number field). These **MUST** be handled gracefully in the UI with specific, user-friendly messages in Portuguese. They **MUST NOT** trigger an error boundary.
    - **System Errors:** Unexpected errors (e.g., network failure, bugs in the code). These **SHOULD** be caught and trigger a user-friendly error boundary.
- **Test Coverage:** All code changes must be accompanied by corresponding new or updated tests. No orphaned tests.

### 6.3. Types of Tests to Perform
When adding features or fixing bugs, ensure coverage for:
- **Validation Tests:** Check for required fields, correct data types, and non-negative values where applicable.
- **Calculation Tests:** Verify that all reactive calculations (e.g., total daily macros) are correct and update instantly.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the end-to-end flow of a feature (e.g., changing a macro target in the profile and seeing it reflected in the daily diet view).
- **Boundary/Edge Case Tests:** Test with extreme values (0, very large numbers, empty strings, long strings, empty arrays, large arrays, `NaN`, `Infinity`).
- **Performance/Stress Tests:** For intensive operations, test with a large number of items to ensure the UI remains responsive.

### 6.4. Search-Specific Testing
- All user-facing search features **MUST** be tested to be both **diacritic-insensitive** and **case-insensitive** for Portuguese (pt-BR) text.

## 7. Automated Workflows & Commands

This project relies on a set of automated commands to ensure consistency and quality. You should use and follow these workflows.

- **`/fix`:** A comprehensive health check. It runs `pnpm check` and attempts to auto-fix any issues. Use this to ensure the codebase is clean before starting work or committing.
- **`/implement <issue-number>`:** The standard workflow for implementing a feature or bug fix. It handles creating a git worktree, analyzing the issue, and guiding the implementation process. **Crucially, it requires passing `pnpm check` before completion.**
- **`/commit`:** Automates the creation of Conventional Commit messages. It analyzes staged changes and generates a compliant message in English. Use this to maintain a clean and standardized commit history.
- **`/pull-request`:** Automates the creation of GitHub Pull Requests. It uses the commit information to create a well-formed PR, linking it to the relevant issue.

### 7.6. Agent Interaction with External Tools (e.g., GitHub MCP Server)

When external tools, such as the `github-mcp-server`, are integrated into the agent's environment, they expose their functionalities as callable functions. The agent interacts with these tools by directly invoking these functions with the required parameters, similar to how it uses its built-in `default_api` tools.

For example, if the `github-mcp-server` exposes a tool to list GitHub issues, the agent would use it as a direct function call:

```python
default_api.list_issues(owner="octocat", repo="Spoon-Knife", state="open")
```

The availability and specific parameters of these external tools depend on their integration with the agent's environment. The agent will discover and utilize them as part of its available toolset.

## 8. Historical Context & Future Direction

Be aware of the following technical debt and future plans:

- **Deprecation of `src/legacy`:** This directory is being phased out. Do not use any code from it. All new code should follow the current architecture.
- **Migration to `UnifiedItem`:** The legacy `Item` type is being replaced by `UnifiedItem`. All new features should use `UnifiedItem`. Be mindful of this when working with older parts of the codebase.
- **Refactoring Goals:**
    - **Introduce a Service Layer:** There is a known need for an explicit service layer to better encapsulate business logic and reduce coupling.
    - **Decouple Modules:** Actively work towards reducing dependencies between modules.
    - **Improve State Management:** Move away from using `createSignal` for global state and towards more structured solutions like stores or contexts.

## 9. Final Reminders
- **TODOs:** Never remove `TODO` comments from the codebase.
- **Labels:** When creating issues, use the labels defined in `docs/labels-usage.md`.
- **Session Start:** Always run `export GIT_PAGER=cat` at the beginning of a session to prevent interactive pager issues with `git`.

# QA Workflow for Macroflows 

## Development server
- **Start the development server:** Run `pnpm dev` to start the local development server.
- **Access the app:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the Macroflows app.

## ✅ Purpose

This workflow defines the exact steps and constraints that an automation agent must follow to interact with the UI of the Macroflows app using Playwright safely and predictably. It assumes the agent has no implicit understanding of UI behavior or loading dynamics. Every step must be followed precisely and in order.

---

## 1. Navigation and Load Validation

- Always wait for the full page to load after navigation.
- Do not proceed until the network has become idle.
- Confirm that the main content of the page has rendered.
- If a loading spinner or overlay exists, wait until it is fully removed.
- Never assume the page is ready based on time alone.

---

## 2. Element Presence and Visibility Before Interaction

Before interacting with any UI element (clicking, filling, selecting):

- Ensure the element is present in the DOM.
- Ensure the element is visible to the user.
- Ensure the element is enabled and interactive.
- Do not proceed with the interaction until all of the above are confirmed.

---

## 3. Never Assume Absence = Error

- If an element is not found:
  - Check if the correct page was loaded.
  - Wait a few extra seconds for slow UI states.
  - Double-check the selector or test identifier.
- Never assume that missing elements indicate a frontend bug without verifying the full context.

---

## 4. Post-Interaction Assertions

- After every interaction, verify the result.
- Confirm that UI changes occurred as expected (new element appears, button becomes disabled, toast message appears, etc).
- Do not proceed to the next action without verifying the outcome of the previous one.

---

## 5. No Manual Loops or Timeouts

- Never use retry loops, sleep functions, or manual time delays.
- All waiting must be based on the presence, visibility, or state of UI elements.
- Time-based waiting introduces flakiness and must be avoided entirely.

---

## 6. Error Recovery and Diagnostics

- On any failure:
  - Capture a full-page screenshot for diagnostics.
  - Capture the visible DOM tree (HTML snapshot).
  - Record what was expected and what was missing.
- Do not silently ignore errors or continue after a failure.

---

## 7. Selector Best Practices

- Prefer stable, semantic, and test-specific selectors (e.g., `data-testid`).
- Avoid selectors that depend on visual layout (e.g., position, nth-child).
- Avoid selectors based on dynamic text unless the text is guaranteed to be static.
- Never use XPath.
- Do not use class names that may change with styling updates.

---

## 8. Final Rules Summary

- Never interact with the page until it is fully loaded and stable.
- Never click or fill without confirming the element is visible and enabled.
- Always assert the outcome of every interaction.
- Always produce diagnostic artifacts on failure.
- Never rely on timing, loops, or assumptions.
- Every action must be justified by explicit confirmation of UI state.

---

## ✅ Goal

This workflow must be followed strictly and completely. Any deviation from this process can lead to invalid, flaky, or misleading test results. The agent is expected to follow every step **explicitly** with no shortcuts, assumptions, or "smart" behavior.

# Serena MCP for efficient editting

You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have                                                                                                       
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a frugal and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code.
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool),
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED! CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND
SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!

You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question
or complete the task. You can also use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.
If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase. This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.

Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbols` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file
or directory, or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.

You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.

The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads,
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.
However, if serena's tools can be used for achieving your task (see initial instructions),
you should prioritize them.


Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.


- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbols` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file
or directory, or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

Now let us discuss the regex-based approach.
The regex-based approach is your primary tool for editing code whenever replacing or deleting a whole symbol would be a more expensive operation.
This is the case if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a method, or a chunk that is much smaller than a whole symbol.
You use other tools to find the relevant content and
then use your knowledge of the codebase to write the regex, if you haven't collected enough information of this content yet.
You are extremely good at regex, so you never need to check whether the replacement produced the correct result.
In particular, you know what to escape and what not to escape, and you know how to use wildcards.
Also, the regex tool never adds any indentation (contrary to the symbolic editing tools), so you have to take care to add the correct indentation
when using it to insert code.
Moreover, the replacement tool will fail if it can't perform the desired replacement, and this is all the feedback you need.
Your overall goal for replacement operations is to use relatively short regexes, since I want you to minimize the number
of output tokens. For replacements of larger chunks of code, this means you intelligently make use of wildcards for the middle part
and of characteristic snippets for the before/after parts that uniquely identify the chunk.

For small replacements, up to a single line, you follow the following rules:

  1. If the snippet to be replaced is likely to be unique within the file, you perform the replacement by directly using the escaped version of the
    original.
  2. If the snippet is probably not unique, and you want to replace all occurrences, you use the `allow_multiple_occurrences` flag.
  3. If the snippet is not unique, and you want to replace a specific occurrence, you make use of the code surrounding the snippet
    to extend the regex with content before/after such that the regex will have exactly one match.
  4. You generally assume that a snippet is unique, knowing that the tool will return an error on multiple matches. You only read more file content
    (for crafvarting a more specific regex) if such a failure unexpectedly occurs.

Examples:

1 Small replacement
You have read code like

  ```python
  ...
  x = linear(x)
  x = relu(x)
  return x
  ...
  ```

and you want to replace `x = relu(x)` with `x = gelu(x)`.
You first try `replace_regex()` with the regex `x = relu\(x\)` and the replacement `x = gelu(x)`.
If this fails due to multiple matches, you will try `(linear\(x\)\s*)x = relu\(x\)(\s*return)` with the replacement `\1x = gelu(x)\2`.

2 Larger replacement

You have read code like

```python
def my_func():
  ...
  # a comment before the snippet
  x = add_fifteen(x)
  # beginning of long section within my_func
  ....
  # end of long section
  call_subroutine(z)
  call_second_subroutine(z)
```
and you want to replace the code starting with `x = add_fifteen(x)` until (including) `call_subroutine(z)`, but not `call_second_subroutine(z)`.
Initially, you assume that the the beginning and end of the chunk uniquely determine it within the file.
Therefore, you perform the replacement by using the regex `x = add_fifteen\(x\)\s*.*?call_subroutine\(z\)`
and the replacement being the new code you want to insert.

If this fails due to multiple matches, you will try to extend the regex with the content before/after the snippet and match groups.
The matching regex becomes:
`(before the snippet\s*)x = add_fifteen\(x\)\s*.*?call_subroutine\(z\)`
and the replacement includes the group as (schematically):
`\1<new_code>`

Generally, I remind you that you rely on the regex tool with providing you the correct feedback, no need for more verification!

IMPORTANT: REMEMBER TO USE WILDCARDS WHEN APPROPRIATE! I WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY IF YOU WRITE LONG REGEXES WITHOUT USING WILDCARDS INSTEAD!
