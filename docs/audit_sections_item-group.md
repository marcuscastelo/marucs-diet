# Sections Audit â€“ Item-Group Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-19_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `item-group` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Migration to Unified System (Completed)
**Major architectural change completed:** All item-group specific view/edit components have been successfully migrated to the unified system:
- **Removed:** `ItemGroupView` and all item-group specific wrappers and helper components
- **Removed:** Item-group specific context providers and state management
- **Removed:** Duplicate clipboard, schema validation, and ID regeneration logic that was scattered across multiple components
- **Migrated:** All item-group functionality now flows through `UnifiedItemView`, `UnifiedItemEditModal`, and `UnifiedItemListView`
- **Improved:** Consistent type conversion through `itemGroupToUnifiedItem` utility centralizes business logic

This migration has eliminated the significant code duplication that existed between item-group and other edit modals (meal, recipe) by providing a single, unified approach to handling all item types.

## Key Findings
- **Duplication Eliminated:** The unified system migration has resolved the major duplication issues (clipboard logic, schema validation, ID regeneration) that previously existed across item-group and other edit modals.
- **Business Logic Centralization:** Domain logic (group operations, ID regeneration, overflow checks) is now better centralized in the unified components rather than scattered across UI components.
- **Legacy Utility Reduction:** The migration has reduced reliance on legacy utilities (`regenerateId`, `deepCopy`, `macroOverflow`) by centralizing this logic in the unified system.
- **Component Boundaries:** The unified system provides clearer component boundaries and better separation of concerns.

## Urgency
- **Low:** Monitor unified system performance for item-group specific use cases and optimize if needed.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor unified system performance for item-group specific operations.
- [ ] Continue reducing any remaining legacy utility usage through the unified system.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for item-group functionality in the unified system.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Monitor usage patterns in the unified system and consider item-group specific optimizations if needed.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns in the unified system.
- Continue strengthening boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers.
