# Session Learnings for Next Input

## Checklist

- [ ] New user preferences or workflow adjustments
- [ ] Coding conventions or process clarifications
- [ ] Issues encountered (e.g., missing commands, lint errors, blockers)
- [ ] Information/context to provide at next session start
- [ ] Prompt metadata or workflow issues to flag
- [ ] Shell/OS-specific requirements

## Actionable Learnings and Blockers (Examples)

- No new actionable learnings or blockers were identified in this session.
- No missing commands, lint errors, or workflow blockers occurred.
- All prompt metadata fields are valid and use only allowed values.
- No shell or OS-specific issues were encountered (current OS: Linux, shell: zsh).

If any of the above change in a future session, please enumerate them here for continuity.

# Prompt/Instruction Improvement Suggestions

- No improvements are required for the current prompts or instructions. All files are actionable, self-contained, and compliant with best practices.
- If new actionable learnings or blockers are identified in a future session, update the relevant prompt files to include explicit examples and checklist guidance.
- Continue to flag any prompt metadata or workflow issues immediately for correction before the next session.

**Note:** After an end-session declaration, the agent must act immediately without waiting for further user input. Always use a checklist format for session learnings and flag any prompt metadata or workflow issues. Note any shell or OS-specific requirements that affect command execution.
