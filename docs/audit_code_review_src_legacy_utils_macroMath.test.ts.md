# Audit: src/legacy/utils/macroMath.test.ts

## Summary of Changes
- New test file added for macroMath utility functions.
- Provides coverage for macro direction, item macros, container macros, recipe/group/meal/day macros, and calorie calculations.

## Strengths
- Improves test coverage for legacy macroMath utilities.
- Uses static imports and type-safe mocks in line with project conventions.
- Covers main behaviors and edge cases for macro calculations.

## Issues/Concerns
- Ensure all new and existing macroMath functions are covered as the utility evolves.
- Test file may need to be updated if macro logic or types change.

## Recommendations
- Periodically review and expand test coverage as new features are added.
- Maintain alignment with domain model and macro calculation logic.
