# Diet Domain Audit â€“ Item Submodule

_Last updated: 2025-06-27_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `item` submodule within the diet domain after the unified item system migration. All legacy item view/edit components and context providers have been removed. The codebase now uses unified item types, conversion utilities, and shared logic for all item, group, and recipe flows.

## Migration to Unified System (Completed)
- **Removed:** All legacy item view/edit components, wrappers, and context providers
- **Migrated:** All item flows now use unified item types and shared conversion utilities
- **Centralized:** Validation, macro overflow, and clipboard logic are now handled in unified utilities and components
- **Improved:** Type safety and maintainability through shared conversion utilities and type guards
- **Test Coverage:** All tests now use unified item factories and conversion utilities

## Key Findings
- **ID Generation in Domain:** Remaining ID generation should be moved to infrastructure or application
- **Schema/Type Logic:** Zod schemas are used for validation and transformation; logic is now isolated for clarity
- **Repository Interface:** The domain should define a repository interface for items
- **Error Handling:** No direct use of `handleApiError` in domain (correct); custom error classes for domain invariants should be added
- **Test Coverage:** All tests now use unified item factories; review for edge cases

## Urgency
- **Low:** Monitor unified system performance and optimize as needed

## Next Steps
- [ ] Refactor ID generation to infrastructure/application
- [ ] Audit all domain files for legacy/shared utility imports
- [ ] Define and document an `ItemRepository` interface in the domain
- [ ] Add and document custom error types for domain invariants
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for item domain logic

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Expand audit to cover cross-module dependencies (e.g., meal, recipe)
- Review Zod schema usage for separation of validation vs. transformation
- Propose stricter contracts for domain operations and invariants
- Consider further optimizations to the unified item system based on usage patterns
