# Sections Audit â€“ Food-Item Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-19_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `food-item` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Migration to Unified System (Completed)
**Major architectural change completed:** All food-item specific view/edit components have been migrated to the unified system:
- **Removed:** `ItemView`, `ItemEditModal`, `ItemListView` and related wrappers
- **Removed:** `ExternalItemEditModal` component and its wrapper logic
- **Removed:** `ItemContext` and item-specific context providers
- **Migrated:** All usage now flows through `UnifiedItemView`, `UnifiedItemEditModal`, and `UnifiedItemListView`
- **Relocated:** `RemoveFromRecentButton` moved to `src/sections/common/components/buttons/` for better organization
- **Improved:** Consistent type conversion through `itemToUnifiedItem` utility eliminates business logic duplication

This migration eliminated significant code duplication and simplified the component hierarchy while maintaining all functionality.

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Centralization:** With the unified system migration, business logic (validation, macro overflow, item state) is now better centralized in the unified components rather than scattered across multiple item-specific components.
- **Legacy Utility Usage:** Some remaining components may still use legacy or shared utilities for calculations or state, which should be abstracted away.
- **Component Boundaries:** The unified system provides clearer component boundaries and reduces prop drilling compared to the previous item-specific approach.
- **Duplication Eliminated:** The migration has resolved most duplication between food-item and other sections through the unified approach.

## Urgency
- **Medium:** Continue refactoring any remaining legacy utility usage to use application/domain abstractions.
- **Low:** Review and monitor the unified system for any food-item specific optimizations needed.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor unified system performance for food-item specific use cases.
- [ ] Continue replacing any remaining legacy utility usage with application/domain abstractions.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for the unified system integration.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Monitor unified system usage patterns and consider food-item specific optimizations if needed.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns in the unified system.
- Continue strengthening boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers.
