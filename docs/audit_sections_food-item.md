# Sections Audit â€“ Food-Item Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-27_

## Overview
The food-item section now exclusively uses the unified item system. All legacy food-item view/edit components, context providers, and related utilities have been removed. The codebase now relies on unified components and shared utilities for all item, group, and recipe flows.

## Unified System Migration (Completed)
- **Removed:** All legacy food-item view/edit components, wrappers, and context providers
- **Migrated:** All food-item flows now use unified item types and shared conversion utilities
- **Centralized:** Validation, macro overflow, and clipboard logic are now handled in unified utilities and components
- **Improved:** Type safety and maintainability through shared conversion utilities and type guards
- **Test Coverage:** All tests now use unified item factories and conversion utilities

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Centralization:** All business logic is now centralized in unified components and utilities
- **Legacy Utility Usage:** Remaining legacy utility usage is isolated and scheduled for migration
- **Component Boundaries:** Clearer boundaries and reduced prop drilling
- **Duplication Eliminated:** No more duplication between food-item and other sections

## Urgency
- **Low:** Monitor unified system performance and optimize as needed

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor unified system performance for food-item specific use cases
- [ ] Continue replacing any remaining legacy utility usage
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for the unified system integration

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Monitor usage patterns and consider further optimizations as needed
- Audit context usage and state management in the unified system
- Continue strengthening boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers
