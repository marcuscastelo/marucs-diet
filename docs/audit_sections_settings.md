# Sections Audit â€“ Settings Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `settings` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Delegation:** Components (e.g., `ToastSettings`) correctly delegate state management and persistence to the infrastructure layer (`modules/toast/infrastructure/toastSettings`). This is a good example of separation of concerns.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are well-structured, with clear separation between UI and state management.
- **Duplication:** No significant duplication observed, but settings logic should be reviewed across all settings-related components for consistency.
- **Testability:** State and logic are abstracted, making components easier to test.

## Urgency
- **Low:** Continue to ensure all settings logic is handled in the application/infrastructure layer or hooks, not in UI components.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Audit all settings section components for business logic leakage or duplication.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for UI and settings logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider unifying settings logic if used in multiple sections.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns.
- Propose stricter boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers if needed.
