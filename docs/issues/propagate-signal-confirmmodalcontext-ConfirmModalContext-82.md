# Refactor Template

**Title:**
Propagate actions signal in ConfirmModalContext for improved state management

**Description:**
Refactor `ConfirmModalContext` to ensure that the `actions` signal is properly propagated and managed throughout the context. Update all usages, types, and documentation to reflect this change. Ensure that modal state management is consistent and testable.

**Scope:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `actions` signal is propagated as needed in ConfirmModalContext
- [ ] All usages, types, and documentation are updated
- [ ] All affected tests are updated

**Additional Context:**
- Review all usages of the `actions` signal in the codebase
- See `docs/audit_sections_common.md` for related architectural notes

**Labels:**
