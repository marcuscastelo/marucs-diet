# Issue: Create Application Audit Files for Complex Modules

**Priority:** Relevant â€” Useful for future improvements, but not essential now.

**Area:** Application Layer (modules with complex orchestration or async logic)

## Background
The audit ([audit_application.md](../audit_application.md)) recommends creating module-specific application audit files for areas with complex orchestration or async logic, to enable focused improvements.

## Task
- Identify modules with complex orchestration or async logic.
- Create `audit_application_<module>.md` files for these modules.
- Document findings and recommendations in each file.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All complex modules have dedicated application audit files.
- Findings and recommendations are documented.
- All checks pass (`npm run check`).
