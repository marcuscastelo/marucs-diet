**Priority:** Critical â€” Immediate action required for DDD compliance and business rule safety.

**Area:** Cross-Cutting Concerns & DDD Pitfalls

- Refactor to ensure they are encapsulated in domain entities or value objects.
- Update or remove related tests as necessary.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All business rules and invariants are encapsulated in domain entities/value objects.
- All changes are covered by updated or new tests.
- All checks pass (`npm run check`).
