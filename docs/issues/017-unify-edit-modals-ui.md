# Issue: Unify or Consolidate Edit Modals/Views in UI Sections

**Priority:** Relevant â€” Useful for codebase consistency and maintainability, but not essential now.

**Area:** UI/Sections Layer (edit modals/views: meal, recipe, item-group)

## Background
The audit ([audit_sections.md](../audit_sections.md)) found that edit modals/views (e.g., meal, recipe, item-group) have highly similar logic, leading to duplication and maintenance overhead.

## Task
- Review edit modals/views for meal, recipe, and item-group.
- Unify or consolidate logic where possible.
- Update or remove related tests as necessary.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Edit modals/views are unified or consolidated where logic is similar.
- All changes are covered by updated or new tests.
- All checks pass (`npm run check`).
