# Refactor Template

**Title:**
Use repository pattern in ItemGroupView

**Description:**
Refactor the `ItemGroupView` component to utilize the repository pattern through dedicated use cases, rather than directly accessing repositories. This will improve separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

**Scope:**
- src/sections/item-group/components/ItemGroupView.tsx
- Related modals and contexts
- Any direct repository usages in the item group feature

**Motivation:**
Direct repository usage in UI components leads to tight coupling and makes testing and future changes harder. Adopting the repository pattern via use cases aligns with clean architecture principles, making the codebase more robust and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `ItemGroupView` only interacts with repositories via use cases
- [ ] All direct repository usages in the item group feature are removed
- [ ] Modals and contexts are updated to use the new pattern
- [ ] All affected tests and documentation are updated

**Additional Context:**
- Review and update related documentation and tests for consistency
- Ensure all usages of repositories in the item group feature are routed through use cases
- See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` for clean architecture guidelines
