# Profile Domain Audit

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `profile` module for DDD adherence, modularity, and architectural issues. The module currently only contains an application layer (`profile.ts`), with no explicit domain or infrastructure layers.

## Key Findings
- **Domain Layer Absence:** There is no explicit domain layer for profile logic. All logic is handled in the application layer, which may lead to mixing business rules with orchestration and UI concerns.
- **Schema/Type Logic:** No domain schemas or types are defined for profile entities, which may reduce type safety and clarity.
- **Error Handling:** Error handling is likely performed in the application layer, but without a domain layer, business rule errors may not be clearly separated.
- **Test Coverage:** Test files for profile logic are not present in the domain or application layer.

## Urgency
- **High:** Define a domain layer for profile logic to separate business rules from orchestration and UI.
- **Medium:** Introduce schemas/types for profile entities and operations.
- **Low:** Add test coverage for profile domain logic once established.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Design and implement a domain layer for profile logic.
- [ ] Define and document schemas/types for profile entities.
- [ ] Refactor application logic to delegate business rules to the domain layer.
- [ ] Add and improve test coverage for profile domain logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Expand audit to cover cross-module dependencies (e.g., user, measure).
- Propose stricter contracts for domain operations and invariants.
