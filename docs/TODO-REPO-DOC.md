# TODO: Repository Documentation Enhancement Plan

## ðŸ“‹ **PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION PLAN**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Contextualize architectural decisions as a senior developer would**

---

## **1. ROOT README.md - VisÃ£o Geral do Sistema**

```markdown
# Marucs Diet - Nutrition Tracking Platform

## Architecture Overview

This application demonstrates production-ready architecture patterns for web applications requiring:
- Complex data migrations
- Backward compatibility
- Clean architecture principles
- Type-safe development

## System Design Decisions

### Multi-Phase Development Approach
The codebase follows a layered migration strategy commonly used in production systems:

**Phase 1: Domain Layer** - Establish unified data models
**Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer** - Implement backward-compatible data access
**Phase 3: Application Layer** - Update UI components for new models

This approach ensures zero-downtime deployments and gradual feature rollouts.

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
Real-world applications often need to support multiple data formats during transitions. This project implements:
- Runtime data migration utilities
- Bidirectional format conversion
- Rollback mechanisms
- Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: SolidJS + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + DDD patterns
```

## **2. DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md - Technical Decisions**

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Unified Item/ItemGroup Model

### Context
The original system used separate `Item` and `ItemGroup` entities, creating complexity in meal composition and macro calculations.

### Decision
Implement a unified `UnifiedItem` model that can represent both individual items and recipe components.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Simplified data model, reduced complexity
- **Negative**: Requires migration of existing data
- **Mitigation**: Implemented backward-compatible runtime migration

## ADR-002: Runtime Migration Strategy

### Context
Production systems often cannot perform database migrations during deployment windows.

### Decision
Implement transparent runtime migration that converts legacy data format on-the-fly.

### Implementation
- Detection logic for legacy vs. new format
- Automatic conversion during data fetching
- Preservation of original data until explicit migration

### Trade-offs
- **Performance**: Additional processing per request
- **Reliability**: Guaranteed backward compatibility
- **Maintenance**: Migration code requires long-term support
```

## **3. Each Module - Technical Context**

### **day-diet/README.md**
```markdown
# Day Diet Module

## Migration Utilities

This module includes comprehensive migration utilities for handling legacy data formats during system transitions.

### Why Runtime Migration?
In production environments, especially those using blue-green deployments or canary releases, database schema migrations must be handled carefully to avoid service interruptions.

### Implementation Details
- `migrationUtils.ts`: Core migration logic
- `migrationUtils.test.ts`: Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
- Backward and forward compatibility ensured

## Usage in Production-Like Scenarios
These utilities are designed to handle scenarios where:
- Multiple application versions run simultaneously
- Database schema changes cannot be applied atomically
- Rollback capabilities are required
```

## **5. Key PRs - Enhanced Descriptions**

### **For Infrastructure PR (Phase 2):**
```markdown
# Infrastructure Layer for Unified Item Model

## Overview
Implements runtime migration capabilities for the unified Item/ItemGroup model, enabling seamless transitions in production environments.

## Key Features
- **Runtime Migration**: Automatic conversion of legacy data formats
- **Bidirectional Compatibility**: Support for both old and new formats
- **Zero-Downtime Strategy**: No service interruption during migration
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Edge cases and rollback scenarios covered

## Production Readiness
This implementation addresses real-world deployment challenges:
- Multiple application versions running simultaneously
- Gradual feature rollout capabilities
- Data integrity preservation during transitions

## Technical Decisions
- Migration happens at the repository layer for clean separation
- Type-safe conversion with comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimized with format detection logic
```

## **6. Code Comments - Contextual Explanations**

### **In supabaseDayRepository.ts:**
```typescript
/**
 * Migrates day data from legacy format to unified format if needed.
 * 
 * This function addresses a common production challenge: supporting multiple
 * data formats during system transitions. In environments where multiple
 * application versions run simultaneously (e.g., canary deployments), 
 * automatic format detection and conversion is essential.
 * 
 * @param dayData Raw data from database (format unknown)
 * @returns Data in current expected format
 */
function migrateDayDataIfNeeded(dayData: unknown): unknown {
```

- Implement with scalability in mind

### Backward Compatibility
- Always consider migration paths
- Test with legacy data scenarios
- Plan for rollback capabilities

### Professional Standards
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Type safety without exceptions
- Clear documentation for complex logic
```
