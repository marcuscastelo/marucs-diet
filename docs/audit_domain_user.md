# User Domain Audit

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `user` module's domain layer for DDD adherence, modularity, and architectural issues. It covers domain logic, schema usage, error handling, and test coverage for `user.ts` and `userRepository.ts`.

## Key Findings
- **ID Generation:** Domain code appears not to generate IDs directly, which is correct. Confirm all ID generation is handled outside the domain.
- **Schema/Type Logic:** Zod schemas are used for validation and transformation. Some transformation logic (e.g., setting `__type`) could be isolated for clarity.
- **Repository Interface:** The domain defines a `UserRepository` interface, which is good for abstraction and testability. Review for strict contracts and nullability.
- **Error Handling:** No direct use of `handleApiError` in domain, which is correct. However, there are no custom error classes for domain invariants or business rules.
- **Test Coverage:** There may be test files for user operations, but coverage of invariants and edge cases should be reviewed.

## Urgency
- **Medium:** Review and enforce strict contracts in the repository interface (avoid nullable returns where possible).
- **Low:** Refactor transformation logic for clarity and add custom error classes for domain rules.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Confirm that all ID generation is handled outside the domain.
- [ ] Review and document the `UserRepository` interface for strictness and nullability.
- [ ] Add and document custom error types for domain invariants.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for user domain logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Expand audit to cover cross-module dependencies (e.g., profile, diet).
- Review Zod schema usage for separation of validation vs. transformation.
- Propose stricter contracts for domain operations and invariants.
