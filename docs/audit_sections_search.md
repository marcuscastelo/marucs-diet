# Sections Audit â€“ Search Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-19_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `search` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Migration to Unified System (Completed)
**Integration with unified system completed:** Search section components have been updated to work with the unified item system:
- **Updated:** `TemplateSearchResults` component refactored to use the shared `templateToUnifiedItem` utility instead of duplicated conversion logic
- **Improved:** Consistent type conversion eliminates code duplication and ensures uniform handling of template items in search results
- **Enhanced:** All search results now flow through the unified system, providing consistent presentation and interaction patterns

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Delegation:** Components (e.g., `TemplateSearchBar`) correctly delegate search state and logic to the application layer (`modules/search/application/search`). This is a good example of separation of concerns.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are well-structured, with clear separation between UI and state management.
- **Duplication Eliminated:** The migration to unified system has removed template conversion duplication that previously existed in search components.
- **Testability:** State and logic are abstracted, making components easier to test.

## Urgency
- **Low:** Continue to ensure all search/filter logic is handled in the application layer or hooks, not in UI components.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor unified system integration in search components for performance and usability.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for search UI and unified system integration.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider expanding unified system integration if other search result types are added.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns.
- Monitor search performance with the unified system and optimize if needed.
