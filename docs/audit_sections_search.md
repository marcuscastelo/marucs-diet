# Sections Audit â€“ Search Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `search` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Delegation:** Components (e.g., `TemplateSearchBar`) correctly delegate search state and logic to the application layer (`modules/search/application/search`). This is a good example of separation of concerns.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are well-structured, with clear separation between UI and state management.
- **Duplication:** No significant duplication observed in the search bar, but search/filter logic should be reviewed across all search-related components for consistency.
- **Testability:** State and logic are abstracted, making components easier to test.

## Urgency
- **Low:** Continue to ensure all search/filter logic is handled in the application layer or hooks, not in UI components.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Audit all search section components for business logic leakage or duplication.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for UI and search logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider unifying search/filter logic if used in multiple sections.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns.
- Propose stricter boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers if needed.
