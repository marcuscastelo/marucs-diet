# Sections Audit â€“ Search Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-27_

## Overview
The search section now exclusively uses the unified item system for all item, group, and recipe flows. All legacy search result conversion logic has been removed. The codebase now relies on unified components and shared utilities for all item, group, and recipe flows.

## Unified System Migration (Completed)
- **Updated:** All search result conversion logic now uses shared utilities (`templateToUnifiedItem`)
- **Improved:** Consistent type conversion and presentation for all search results
- **Enhanced:** All search results now flow through the unified system, providing consistent UI and interaction patterns

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Delegation:** All search/filter logic is handled in the application layer or hooks, not in UI components
- **Component Boundaries:** Well-structured, with clear separation between UI and state management
- **Duplication Eliminated:** No more duplicated template conversion logic
- **Testability:** State and logic are abstracted, making components easier to test

## Urgency
- **Low:** Monitor unified system integration for performance and usability

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor unified system integration in search components for performance and usability
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for search UI and unified system integration

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Expand unified system integration if other search result types are added
- Audit context usage and state management
- Monitor search performance with the unified system and optimize if needed
