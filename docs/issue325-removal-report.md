# Issue 325 Removal Report

## Summary

This report lists all TODO comments found in the `src` directory and compares them to all open issues (limit 1000) in the repository. Each TODO is checked for linkage to an open issue by number or by matching the issue title. Only TODOs that reference an open issue (by number or clear title match) are considered 'linked'.

## Open Issues (limit 1000)

- See below for linkage analysis. (Full list omitted for brevity; see project issue tracker for details.)
