# Sections Audit â€“ EAN Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `EAN` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Leakage:** Components (e.g., `EANReader`) handle scanner configuration, error handling, and EAN format validation directly in the UI layer. Some of this logic could be abstracted into hooks or the application layer for clarity and reuse.
- **Error Handling:** Uses a shared error handler for scanner errors, which is good, but error context and user feedback could be standardized.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are generally well-structured, but scanner setup and teardown logic could be further isolated.
- **Duplication:** Scanner and EAN handling logic may be duplicated if EAN reading is used in other sections.

## Urgency
- **Medium:** Move scanner configuration and EAN validation logic into hooks or the application layer for reuse and testability.
- **Low:** Standardize error handling and user feedback for scanner errors.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Refactor scanner and EAN logic into shared hooks/utilities.
- [ ] Standardize error handling and user feedback for scanner errors.
- [ ] Audit all EAN section components for business logic leakage and duplication.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for UI logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider unifying scanner logic if EAN reading is used in multiple sections.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns.
- Propose stricter boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers.
