# Weight Module - QA Testing

## üéØ Overview

The Weight module is responsible for managing the user's weight control, including logging weigh-ins, visualizing progress through charts, calculating averages, and tracking progress against goals.

## üèóÔ∏è Main Components

- **Weight Logging**: Logging of weigh-ins with date and time
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracking progress with charts
- **Goal Management**: Comparison with desired weight
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts with different periods
- **Historical Data**: Management of weigh-in history

## üß™ Test Cases

### Test W-01: Log New Weight
**Priority**: üî¥ Critical
**Objective**: Validate logging of new weigh-ins

**Prerequisites**:
- User logged in on the /profile#weight page
- Access to the weight input field

**Steps**:
1. Enter weight in the field (e.g., 75.5)
2. Check if the value is accepted
3. Click "Add weight"
4. Check if the entry appears in the list
5. Check if the chart updates
6. Check if the statistics update
7. Try to add a duplicate weight for the same time

**Expected Result**:
- Weight logged with the current timestamp
- Weight list updated instantly
- Chart reflects the new entry
- Statistics recalculated (average, progress)
- Validation of duplicate entries

**Edge Cases**:
- Very low weight (< 30kg)
- Very high weight (> 300kg)
- Values with many decimal places
- Negative or zero weight
- Multiple entries in the same minute

### Test W-02: Edit Existing Weights

**Steps**:
1. Check the progress indicator (e.g., 100% + 87.0kg üéâ)
2. Manually calculate the average for the period
3. Compare with the displayed value
4. Change the target weight in the profile
5. Check for recalculation of progress
6. Add a new weigh-in
7. Check for automatic update

**Expected Result**:
- Progress calculated correctly
- Accurate mathematical average
- Automatic update when changing the goal
