# Sections Audit â€“ Datepicker Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `datepicker` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Leakage:** Some date parsing, formatting, and range logic is handled directly in UI components (e.g., `Datepicker.tsx`), rather than being abstracted into hooks or utility modules.
- **Legacy/External Utility Usage:** Components use external libraries (e.g., `dayjs`) and custom helpers for date manipulation, which is appropriate, but some logic could be further isolated for clarity and reuse.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are generally well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, but some state and effect management could be moved to hooks for testability.
- **Duplication:** Date formatting and range logic may be duplicated across datepicker and other sections (e.g., day-diet, profile).

## Urgency
- **Medium:** Refactor date parsing, formatting, and range logic into shared hooks/utilities for reuse and testability.
- **Low:** Review and clarify component boundaries and state management.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Refactor date logic into shared hooks/utilities.
- [ ] Audit all datepicker section components for business logic leakage and duplication.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for UI logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider unifying date logic if used in multiple sections.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns.
- Propose stricter boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers.
