# Sections/UI Layer Audit

_Last updated: 2025-06-27_

## Overview
Sections and UI components now exclusively use the unified item system for all item, group, and recipe flows. All legacy section-specific item/group components and context providers have been removed. Business logic (validation, macro overflow, clipboard, ID management) is centralized in unified components and shared utilities.

## Unified System Migration (Completed)
- **Removed:** All legacy item, item-group, and related view/edit components from sections (e.g., `ItemView`, `ItemEditModal`, `ItemGroupView`, `ItemListView`, `ExternalItemEditModal`, context providers)
- **Migrated:** All section flows now use `UnifiedItemView`, `UnifiedItemEditModal`, and `UnifiedItemListView` for all item types
- **Centralized:** Clipboard, validation, and macro logic are now handled in unified utilities and components
- **Improved:** Type safety and maintainability through shared conversion utilities and type guards
- **Reduced:** Prop drilling and code duplication across sections

## Key Findings
- **Duplication Eliminated:** All major duplication between meal, recipe, item, and group flows has been resolved
- **Business Logic Centralization:** Validation, macro overflow, and clipboard logic are now centralized
- **Type Safety:** All conversions and type guards are handled by shared utilities
- **Legacy Utility Removal:** Most legacy utilities and context providers have been removed; remaining usage is isolated
- **Test Coverage:** All section tests now use unified item factories and conversion utilities

## Urgency
- **Low:** Monitor unified system performance and optimize as needed

## Next Steps
- [ ] Continue migration of any remaining legacy utilities
- [ ] Monitor unified system performance and optimize as needed
- [ ] Expand audits to cover async flows, error propagation, and cross-module dependencies
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for all modules and shared utilities

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Monitor usage patterns and consider further optimizations as needed
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns in the unified system
- Continue strengthening boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers
