# Sections Audit â€“ Common Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-19_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `common` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment. The common section provides shared UI elements (e.g., modals, buttons, inputs, icons) used across multiple sections.

## Migration to Unified System (Completed)
**Enhanced with unified system components:** The common section has been enhanced as part of the unified system migration:
- **Added:** `RemoveFromRecentButton` relocated from `src/sections/food-item/components/` to `src/sections/common/components/buttons/` for better organization and reusability
- **Enhanced:** Common components now support the unified item system, providing consistent UI patterns across all item types (food items, recipes, groups)
- **Improved:** Better separation of concerns with shared components focusing purely on UI presentation while delegating all business logic to the unified system

## Key Findings
- **Separation of Concerns:** Components (e.g., `ClipboardActionButtons`) are focused on UI presentation and delegate logic to props/callbacks, which is good practice.
- **Reusability:** Common components are designed for reuse and composability across the codebase, now enhanced by the unified system integration.
- **Duplication Eliminated:** The unified system migration has eliminated the need for multiple similar components, with shared logic now properly centralized in common components.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are well-structured, with clear separation between UI and logic. State and effects are managed outside, via hooks or parent components.

## Urgency
- **Low:** Continue to ensure all logic is handled in the application layer or hooks, not in UI components.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor the performance and usage of newly relocated components like `RemoveFromRecentButton`.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for shared UI components and their integration with the unified system.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider expanding the set of shared components if common patterns emerge from the unified system usage.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns in the unified system.
- Monitor for opportunities to extract more shared components as the unified system matures.
