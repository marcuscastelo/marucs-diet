# Sections Audit â€“ Common Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `common` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment. The common section provides shared UI elements (e.g., modals, buttons, inputs, icons) used across multiple sections.

## Key Findings
- **Separation of Concerns:** Components (e.g., `ClipboardActionButtons`) are focused on UI presentation and delegate logic to props/callbacks, which is good practice.
- **Reusability:** Common components are designed for reuse and composability across the codebase.
- **Duplication:** No significant duplication observed within the common section, but ensure shared logic (e.g., clipboard, modal state) is not re-implemented in consuming sections.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are well-structured, with clear separation between UI and logic. State and effects are managed outside, via hooks or parent components.

## Urgency
- **Low:** Continue to ensure all logic is handled in the application layer or hooks, not in UI components.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Audit all common section components for unnecessary logic or duplication.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for shared UI components.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider expanding the set of shared hooks/utilities if common logic is identified in consuming sections.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns.
- Propose stricter boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers if needed.
