# Sections Audit â€“ Common Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-27_

## Overview
The common section now provides shared UI elements (modals, buttons, icons, etc.) fully compatible with the unified item system. All shared UI logic is centralized, and legacy/duplicated components have been removed.

## Unified System Migration (Completed)
- **Relocated:** `RemoveFromRecentButton` and other shared UI elements are now in the common section for reusability
- **Enhanced:** All common components support the unified item system, providing consistent UI patterns for food, recipe, and group items
- **Improved:** Separation of concerns and reusability, with all business logic delegated to the unified system
- **Duplication Eliminated:** No more parallel or duplicated shared UI components

## Key Findings
- **Separation of Concerns:** All logic is handled in the application layer or hooks, not in UI components
- **Reusability:** Common components are designed for reuse and composability across the codebase
- **Component Boundaries:** Clear separation between UI and logic

## Urgency
- **Low:** Monitor performance and usage of shared components

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor performance and usage of shared components
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for shared UI components

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Expand the set of shared components as new patterns emerge
- Audit context usage and state management in the unified system
