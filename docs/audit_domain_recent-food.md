# Recent-Food Domain Audit

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `recent-food` module's domain layer for DDD adherence, modularity, and architectural issues. It covers domain logic, schema usage, error handling, and test coverage for `recentFood.ts`.

## Key Findings
- **ID Generation:** Domain code appears not to generate IDs directly, which is correct. Confirm all ID generation is handled outside the domain.
- **Schema/Type Logic:** Zod schemas are used for validation and transformation. Some transformation logic (e.g., date parsing, setting `__type`) could be isolated for clarity.
- **Repository Interface:** The domain does not define a repository interface for recent-food, which may limit testability and abstraction.
- **Error Handling:** No direct use of `handleApiError` in domain, which is correct. However, there are no custom error classes for domain invariants or business rules.
- **Test Coverage:** There may be test files for recent-food operations, but coverage of invariants and edge cases should be reviewed.

## Urgency
- **Medium:** Define a repository interface for recent-food in the domain layer.
- **Low:** Refactor transformation logic for clarity and add custom error classes for domain rules.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Confirm that all ID generation is handled outside the domain.
- [ ] Define and document a `RecentFoodRepository` interface in the domain.
- [ ] Add and document custom error types for domain invariants.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for recent-food domain logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Expand audit to cover cross-module dependencies (e.g., food, user).
- Review Zod schema usage for separation of validation vs. transformation.
- Propose stricter contracts for domain operations and invariants.
