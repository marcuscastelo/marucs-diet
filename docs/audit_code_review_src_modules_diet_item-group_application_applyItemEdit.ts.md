# Audit: src/modules/diet/item-group/application/applyItemEdit.ts

## Summary of Changes
- New application-layer utility to update a TemplateItem in the current day diet.
- Handles group and meal traversal, updates items, and calls updateItemGroup.

## Strengths
- Follows clean architecture: pure domain logic is separated from application orchestration.
- Uses static imports and type-safe parameters.
- Provides a single point for item edit application, improving maintainability.

## Issues/Concerns
- Ensure error handling is robust and all edge cases are covered.
- Test coverage for this utility should be maintained as logic evolves.

## Recommendations
- Periodically review for error handling improvements and test coverage.
- Document any changes to the item/group/meal structure that may affect this utility.
