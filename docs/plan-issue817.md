# Implementation Plan for Issue #817

## Title
Optimize food reordering logic to reduce O(n²) complexity to O(n)

## Summary
Refactor the food reordering logic in the codebase to replace inefficient `Array.find` inside `map` operations with a Map-based lookup, achieving O(n) complexity. Ensure all related files and usages are updated, tests are added/updated, and performance improvements are measurable.

## Steps

1. **Identify All Usages**
   - Search the codebase for instances where `Array.find` is used inside a `map` for food reordering or similar logic.
   - List all affected files and functions.

2. **Refactor Logic**
   - Replace the `Array.find` inside `map` with a Map-based lookup as per the reference implementation:
     ```ts
     const foodMap = new Map(foods.map(f => [f.id, f]));
     foods = allowedFoods.map(id => foodMap.get(id)).filter((f): f is Food => Boolean(f));
     ```
   - Ensure the new logic is type-safe and matches the existing API/usage.

3. **Update Imports and Usages**
   - If any files have moved or been renamed, update imports accordingly.
   - Ensure all usages of the refactored logic are updated across the codebase.

4. **Testing**
   - Update or add tests to cover the optimized code path.
   - Ensure tests cover edge cases and large datasets for performance.

5. **Performance Validation**
   - Add a test or benchmark to demonstrate the performance improvement for large datasets.
   - Document the results in the PR description.

6. **Code Quality and Documentation**
   - Run code quality checks and custom output validation scripts after changes.
   - Update or add JSDoc for all exported functions/types affected by the refactor.
   - Ensure all code/comments are in English.

7. **Commit and Document**
   - Commit changes with a clear, conventional commit message.
   - Document any intentional logic changes or removals in the commit message and PR description.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All `Array.find` inside `map` for food reordering is replaced with Map-based lookup
- [x] O(n) complexity is achieved and validated
- [x] All existing functionality remains intact
- [x] Tests are updated/added and pass
- [x] Performance improvement is measurable
- [x] JSDoc is updated for all exported types/functions

## Implementation Results
✅ **Completed**: The O(n²) complexity issue has been successfully resolved.

### Changes Made:
1. **File**: `src/modules/search/application/searchLogic.ts`
   - Replaced `Array.find` operations inside the for loop with Map-based lookups
   - Created `foodMap` and `recipeMap` for O(1) lookup operations
   - Maintained exact same functionality and API compatibility

2. **File**: `src/modules/search/application/searchLogic.test.ts`
   - Added comprehensive performance test for large datasets (1000 items)
   - Verified optimization works correctly with sub-second execution time
   - Ensured existing tests continue to pass

### Performance Impact:
- **Before**: O(n²) complexity - for each recent item, search through all foods/recipes
- **After**: O(n) complexity - create maps once, then O(1) lookups for each recent item
- **Measurable improvement**: Large dataset test completes in under 1 second

### Verification:
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ New performance test passes
- ✅ Code quality checks pass
- ✅ Type checking passes
- ✅ Linting passes
