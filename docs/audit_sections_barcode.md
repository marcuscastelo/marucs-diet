# Sections Audit â€“ Barcode Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-07_

## Overview
This audit reviews the `barcode` section UI components, focusing on separation of concerns, code duplication, and DDD alignment.

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Leakage:** Components (e.g., `BarCodeReader`) handle scanner configuration, error handling, and barcode format validation directly in the UI layer. Some of this logic could be abstracted into hooks or the application layer for clarity and reuse.
- **Error Handling:** Uses a shared error handler for scanner errors, which is good, but error context and user feedback could be standardized.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components are generally well-structured, but scanner setup and teardown logic could be further isolated.
- **Duplication:** Scanner and barcode handling logic may be duplicated if barcode reading is used in other sections.

## Urgency
- **Medium:** Move scanner configuration and barcode validation logic into hooks or the application layer for reuse and testability.
- **Low:** Standardize error handling and user feedback for scanner errors.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Refactor scanner and barcode logic into shared hooks/utilities.
- [ ] Standardize error handling and user feedback for scanner errors.
- [ ] Audit all barcode section components for business logic leakage and duplication.
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for UI logic.

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Consider unifying scanner logic if barcode reading is used in multiple sections.
- Expand audit to cover context usage and state management patterns.
- Propose stricter boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers.
