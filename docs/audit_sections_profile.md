# Sections Audit â€“ Profile Section

_Last updated: 2025-06-27_

## Overview
The profile section now benefits from the unified item system migration, with reduced complexity and improved maintainability. While it does not directly use item view components, it leverages shared infrastructure and patterns.

## Unified System Impact
- **Reduced Complexity:** Unified system migration has made profile components easier to maintain
- **Consistent Patterns:** Improved patterns for component organization and business logic separation
- **Shared Infrastructure:** Profile section benefits from improved shared component organization

## Key Findings
- **Business Logic Leakage:** Some calculation logic remains in UI components; should be moved to application layer or hooks
- **Legacy Utility Usage:** Some legacy utilities are still used; should be abstracted away
- **Component Boundaries:** Generally well-structured, but some logic could be moved for clarity

## Urgency
- **Medium:** Refactor business logic into application layer or custom hooks

## Next Steps
- [ ] Refactor business logic into application layer or custom hooks
- [ ] Replace legacy utility usage with application/domain abstractions
- [ ] Audit all profile section components for business logic leakage and duplication
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for UI logic

## Future Refinement Suggestions
- Apply unified system patterns to calculation and chart logic
- Audit context usage and state management
- Propose stricter boundaries between UI, application, and domain layers
