## Overview

Macroflows is a nutrition tracking system focused on strong typing, reactive UI, and modular domain-driven design. It follows clean architecture principles and integrates with modern backend and frontend tools.

For now, it is focused on being a personal project to track my own nutrition, but maybe in the future it will be a SaaS product.
